# Bil_470_ML_Project_DengAI
"DengAI : Predicting Disease Spread" is a Machine Learning competition hosted by DrivenData
Foundation. Competitions is based on predicting the cases of Dengue Fever (a deadly viral disease
that is transmitted by mosquitoes) on a weekly basis using the environmental variables that consists
of temperature, precipitation vegetation and more.
Since Dengue Fever is transmitted by mosquitoes, many studies show that the spread of the disease is
positively correlated with the climate.Given enough historical data, we can try to predict the Dengue
Fever spread using the correlation between the environmental variables and the cases per week. This
document explains the many approaches we tried trying to solve this problem.
